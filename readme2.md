## Image Text Extraction and Visualization using two different method(EasyOCR and Keras-OCR)

This project demonstrates how to read, display, and extract text from images using OpenCV, Matplotlib, and EasyOCR.

### Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- EasyOCR
- Pandas

You can install these packages using pip:

```sh
pip install opencv-python-headless matplotlib easyocr pandas
```

Or you can install all the requirements using requirements.txt:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Resultst

- **EasyOCR:**
  Extracted approximatelyely 60 of the text from the image.
  
- **Keras-OCR:**
  Extracted nearly 90% of the text from the same image.
